# What is this REPO.

This repo contains the Salesforce code components (LWC and Apex) which helps us to assign Crud Permissions to both profiles and permission sets from a single screen in BULK based on Keyword. There are also features that supports exporting the permissions , filtering based on permission sets/profiles/various crud permissions. This App also contains the features for providing FLS permissions to both profiles and permissions in bulkified Mode.
